# Portfolio_Site

This project required a decent amount of looking over of documentation on bootstrap and trying to find a happy medium between using CSS on its own or implementing bootstrap. I found determining what to place as the home page cover in terms of design as the most diffuclt and time consuming part of this exercise-- bootstrap is rather easy to pick up when you figure out the language a bit 

The contact page is giving me the most trouble as of now- it looked fine on my macbook at every screen size, but when I moved over to a different monitor it became a bit more clunky looking... 

The next steps will be to add portfolio content and other small items to continue to fill out the site.
