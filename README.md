# Portfolio_Site

This project required a decent amount of looking over of documentation on bootstrap and trying to find a happy medium between using CSS on its own or implementing bootstrap. I found determining what to place as the home page cover in terms of design as the most diffuclt and time consuming part of this exercise-- bootstrap is rather easy to pick up when you figure out the language a bit 

The contact page is giving me the most trouble as of now- it looked fine on my macbook at every screen size, but when I moved over to a different monitor it became a bit more clunky looking... 

The next steps will be to add portfolio content and other small items to continue to fill out the site. 

I'm wondering if bootstrap is messing up ever-so-slightly on the github pages, since it seems to only break on that....
